Phaarmacy Claims in SQL

# Project overview:
The data in the Excel file offers a glimpse into the world of pharmacy claims processed by a fictitious insurance company. These records include information about prescriptions and how they're paid for. It also comes with a data dictionary that explains what each piece of information means. We'll use this data to learn about how people use prescription drugs and how much they cost, helping us make better healthcare decisions.
